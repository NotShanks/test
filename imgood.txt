You’re no hero#
So don’t act like it#
And please don’t treat me
Like i’m yo sidekick#
Cause I watch T.V#
I see how life is And it’s not easy
But still I’m right here
Screamin’ I’m good,I’m good,I’m good,I’m good Yeah#
My buddy I’m good,I’m good,I’m good,I’m good#
You’re no hero
So don’t act like it#
And please don’t treat me
Like i’m yo sidekick#
Cause I watch T.V#
I see how life is
And it’s not easy#
But still I’m right here
Screamin’
I’m good,I’m good,Yeah#
My dude
I’m good,I’m good,Yeah#
[Abstract:]
Coming up to me#
Like “you still making music,man?”#
Ask them kind questions
Shouldn’t even shake your hand#
Though you were the homie
Still don’t know me#
It’s so ever damn
2 Million views#
And growing
Follow my accomplishments#
I mean
Cause I do work my eee off#
Back up in the game
Like my vocals got the cast off#
All I’ve been is cast off
By those who seem to lack heart#
Tryna give the world some hope
So through the dark#
I’ll cast art
Hoping life’s the way
Brightens your yesterday#
Life’s been dark
And y’all can see I’ve had a lot to say
Few friends have been supportive#
You can tell by how I word it
So being round that energy
I feel I can afford it#
Talking bout I need direction
Samba where is yours
I’ve had mine#
And it’s the only thing
That I’ve been working toward
And I built it from the floor#
Y’all don’t seem to help no more
See it’s hard to movement
Cause the internet’s what opened door#
[Abstract:]
What I mean to say
Is y’all ain’t been about the dream#
Even back in highschool
Y’all weren’t really bout the team
To those who were#
You know I know
And your support means everything#
Bout to prove
Come from anywhere
And become anything
That you can take whatever you like#
And make it everything
What part is bigger than us
We made it everything
And you know#
It’s because I wear my word
Like a wedding ring
Sticking to my cray#
Put honesty above everything
Cause,I ain’t been perfect#
But at least I got a purpose
Rising stars in my contact list
We hit beats and we merk good#
Conversation with the greatest
Can’t wait to say I made it
Shouts to those who say
I helped them get through hard times#
You my favourite
Shouts to channels that upload me
And the haters that can blow me#
And shouts out to a world
Insists of you won't seek control me
Blogs that show me love
And friends who love what we does
Everyone who sees us hitting the before it comes
You’re no hero#
So don’t act like it
And please don’t treat me
Like i’m yo sidekick
Cause I watch T.V#
I see how life is#
And it’s not easy
But still I’m right here
Screamin’ I’m good#
